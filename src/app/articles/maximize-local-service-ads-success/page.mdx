I derive a large amount of my self-worth as a SEO specialist from whether or not my clients' phones are buzzing with incoming leads. So when I realized this I started setting up LSA accounts for them.

Most companies try to stay ahead of the curve when they are attempting to attract new leads and maintain a competitive edge. They look to SEO specialists that cater to broad audiences and look to them to improve organic search rankings.  While organic SEO efforts typically require 8-12 months to see rewards from Google in terms of improved rankings and organic traffic, LSAs can generate solid leads almost instantly, even without a website.

I first used Google's Local Service Ads last year, and it went well for a Pest Control Company I was helping. After loading up the pest control license information, insurance, and profile picture, we were approved in just a few days. The support we received from the Google representative was exceptional; we reached someone on the first try within a few minutes, and they were extremely helpful throughout the process.

When selecting an industry such as pest control, LSAs allow you to niche down to indicate exactly what services you offer. In this instance, we focused on termites, allowing us to target customers specifically looking for termite control services. With a budget of $500 monthly max, we received 10 leads that month and closed on all the sales, demonstrating the effectiveness and ROI of LSAs for niche services like termite control.

## The Secret Cost of Personal Injury Leads
Listen up, fellow legal eagles! When it comes to personal injury law, the price of a lead can send shivers down your spine. We're talking about a hefty $300 to $500 per lead, my friends. But don't let those numbers scare you off just yet.

You see, in the cutthroat world of legal battles and big payouts, every lead is a golden opportunity waiting to be seized. Sure, the competition is fierce, but that's where Google's Local Service Ads (LSAs) swoop in to save the day.

With LSAs, you're not just casting a wide net and hoping for the best. Oh no! These ads are precision-guided missiles aimed straight at the hearts of those in need of legal assistance for their personal injury woes.

So, while the cost may seem steep at first glance, think of it as an investment in your future success. With LSAs by your side, you'll attract the cream of the crop, the high-value cases that make all the difference. It's time to turn those leads into lucrative victories, my legal comrades!

## Secrets to Success with Local Service Ads
Success isn't just about getting leads—it's about how you handle them. I've seen many businesses falter due to simple missteps, but fear not! Here are some insider tips to ensure your Local Service Ads (LSAs) campaign thrives:

### Quick Response Time
Time is of the essence! Answering calls within 8 seconds is not just a recommendation, it's a golden rule. Every second counts when it comes to capturing a potential customer's interest. Be swift, be sharp, and be ready to seize the opportunity.

### Clear Greetings
When answering calls, make sure to indicate the core service you offer right off the bat. This not only helps customers know they've reached the right place but also reduces the chances of receiving wrong numbers. Remember, every missed call could mean a missed opportunity.

### Provide Contact Information
Don't forget the basics! Always ensure that the caller has your company's contact information before hanging up. This includes providing your phone number, website, and any other relevant details. After all, you don't want them calling back and reaching a Google number instead of your business directly.

By implementing these simple yet effective strategies, you can ensure that your Local Service Ads campaign not only attracts leads but also converts them into loyal customers. So, don't just settle for average—aim for excellence and watch your business soar to new heights!

After some research, I decided to give ClickSend a try, initially I was drawn in by their 24/7 live chat support and a clean user dashboard. However, what truly won me over was their remarkable customer service. Matt, my dedicated account representative, reached out promptly and generously credited my account for extensive testing. This gesture made the decision crystal clear. Hence, I ultimately selected ClickSend to fulfill my SMS notification requirements.

I derive a large amount of my self-worth as a SEO specialist from whether or not my clients' phones are buzzing with incoming leads. So when Idem realized this I started setting up LSA accounts for them.

Most companies try to stay ahead of the curve when they are attempting to attract new leads and maintain a competitive edge. They look to SEO specialists that cater to broad audiences and look to them to improve organic search rankings.  While organic SEO efforts typically require 8-12 months to see rewards from Google in terms of improved rankings and organic traffic, LSAs can generate solid leads almost instantly, even without a website.

I first used Google's Local Service Ads last year, and it went well for a Pest Control Company I was helping. After loading up the pest control license information, insurance, and profile picture, we were approved in just a few days. The support we received from the Google representative was exceptional; we reached someone on the first try within a few minutes, and they were extremely helpful throughout the process.

When selecting an industry such as pest control, LSAs allow you to niche down to indicate exactly what services you offer. In this instance, we focused on termites, allowing us to target customers specifically looking for termite control services. With a budget of $500 monthly max, we received 10 leads that month and closed on all the sales, demonstrating the effectiveness and ROI of LSAs for niche services like termite control.

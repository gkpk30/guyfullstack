## Mastering Structured Data Implementation with the Velo Framework API
Structured data holds the key to boosting your CMS articles' visibility, and with the Velo framework API, you're equipped to harness its full potential.

Picture this: You've got your hands on a snippet of code that's about to revolutionize the way search engines perceive your content. By importing the 'wix-seo-frontend' module, you're setting the stage for structured data magic to unfold. Just place it in the javascript File in Dev mode. 

```javascript
import wixSeoFrontend from 'wix-seo-frontend';

$w.onReady(function () {
    // Write your Javascript code here using the Velo framework API
 $w("#dynamicDataset").onReady( () => {
    let itemObj = $w("#dynamicDataset").getCurrentItem();
    console.log("Data:" , itemObj)
    let schema = itemObj.schemaMarkup
    console.log("schema: ", schema )
    wixSeoFrontend.setStructuredData([schema])
  } );
});

```
As you dive into your CMS, each article becomes an opportunity to infuse it with structured data brilliance. With a tweak here and there to the schema markup, tailored to your content's unique attributes, you're poised to captivate search engine crawlers and boost your visibility.

With the Velo framework API by your side, implementing structured data isn't just a taskâ€”it's a journey towards SEO success. So, embrace structured data's power and watch your CMS articles soar to new heights in search engine rankings.
